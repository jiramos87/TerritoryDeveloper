# AI Agent Guide — Territory Developer

## Before You Start

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the project structure, data flows, and dependency map
2. Read `.cursor/rules/` for coding conventions (including **prefab naming for new assets** in `coding-conventions.mdc`) and manager responsibilities
3. Check the `/// <summary>` on the class you are about to modify — it describes its role and dependencies
4. Read `BACKLOG.md` for the current list of issues, priorities, and what's in progress

### Canonical geography specification

For **grid coordinates, height model, terrain slopes, water vs land, shore/cliff layering, sorting, procedural lakes/rivers, water persistence, roads/terraform/bridges/interstate, and pathfinding costs**, treat **`.cursor/specs/isometric-geography-system.md`** as the **single canonical reference**. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** summarizes init order and persistence; it defers geography **mechanisms** to that spec.

Do **not** create a parallel “master” geography doc; extend or fix **`isometric-geography-system.md`** and reference **`BACKLOG.md`** for open issues.

### `.cursor/specs/` policy (avoid spec clutter)

**`.cursor/specs/`** holds only **durable system specifications**:

| File | Scope |
|------|--------|
| `isometric-geography-system.md` | Terrain, water, cliffs, shores, sorting, terraform, roads, rivers, pathfinding |
| `ui-design-system.md` | UI foundations, components, patterns |

Do **not** add bug write-ups, agent prompts, one-off “fix” specs, or archived prompts under `.cursor/specs/`. While work is open, document details in **`BACKLOG.md`** (issue **Notes** / **Files**). When an issue is **completed and verified**, **delete** any temporary markdown artifacts — stale specs pollute agent context.

## Project docs outside `.cursor/specs/`

Charters and discovery for cross-cutting programs (e.g. UI design) live under **`docs/`** as listed in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. There is **no** `specs/archive` or `specs/bugs` folder; do not recreate them for completed work.

## Language
All code, comments, XML docs, annotations, Debug.Log messages, and repository content must be in **English**. Chat with the user may be in any language.

## Backlog: Next Issue and AI Agent Prompts

When the user asks which is the next issue to work on (or similar), respond with the issue and **ask if they want you to create an AI agent prompt** — a prompt for another agent to analyze, evaluate, and propose a development plan in Cursor for the changes needed to resolve the issue, clarifying all questions before writing the plan file.

### Format when delivering an AI agent prompt

Whenever the user asks for an **AI agent prompt** (including after they accept your offer to create one), respond with the prompt as **Markdown**, not unstructured plain text, so it can be copied in one step and saved as a `.md` file without losing headings, lists, or tables.

- **Preferred:** Put the **full** prompt document inside one **fenced code block** with the language tag `markdown`: start with a line containing only three backticks plus `markdown`, end with a line containing only three backticks. The user copies the inner Markdown into a `.md` file (optionally stripping those two fence lines). Inside the block use normal Markdown: `#` / `##` headings, lists, tables, `` `paths` ``, and links such as `[BUG-42](BACKLOG.md)`.
- **Short prompts:** If the prompt fits in a few lines, you may emit the same Markdown **without** a fence in the chat — but for anything longer than a short paragraph, **use the `markdown` fence** so nested lists and code paths do not flatten when copied.
- Prompt **body** for another agent should be in **English** (repository language rule), unless the user explicitly asks for another language for that prompt.

This applies to **any** request to “write a prompt for another agent / subagent,” not only backlog-driven prompts.

## Backlog: After Implementing a Plan
After executing a development plan for an issue, **keep the issue in "In progress"**. Do NOT move it to "Completed". Only move to "Completed" when the user explicitly confirms the fix has been verified (e.g. after testing in Unity).

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Do NOT create new singletons** — use the Inspector + FindObjectOfType pattern
- **Do NOT access `gridArray` or `cellArray` directly** from outside GridManager — use `GetCell(x, y)`
- **Do NOT add more responsibilities to GridManager** — extract to helper classes instead
- **Do NOT use `FindObjectOfType` in Update or loops** — only in Awake/Start
- **Do NOT forget `InvalidateRoadCache()`** after modifying roads
- **Do NOT instantiate managers with `new`** — they are scene components
- **Do NOT re-enable** the obsolete **UrbanizationProposal** flow — removal is **TECH-13** in `BACKLOG.md`
- **Do NOT add** bug reports, agent prompts, or one-off fix specs under **`.cursor/specs/`** — only `isometric-geography-system.md` and `ui-design-system.md` (see **`.cursor/specs/` policy** above)

## Pre-commit Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles (Build in Unity)
- [ ] Class-level `/// <summary>` exists and is accurate
- [ ] New public methods have XML documentation
- [ ] Debug.Log messages and comments are in English
- [ ] If GridManager was touched, verify sorting order works with different height levels
- [ ] If roads were modified, verify `InvalidateRoadCache()` is called where needed
- [ ] If a new manager was added, it follows the Inspector + FindObjectOfType dependency pattern
- [ ] New prefabs / asset names follow `.cursor/rules/coding-conventions.mdc` (do not rename existing assets; use conventions for new variants)
