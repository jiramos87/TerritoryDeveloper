# Parallel Carcass Master-Plans — Exploration

> **Status:** Design closed — ready for natural / dogfood implementation
> **Date:** 2026-04-29
> **Author:** Javier (+ agent)
> **Trigger:** linear master-plans → long-lived, drift-prone, sibling drift, slow human feedback. Proposed: architecture-first → fastest end-to-end "carcass" → parallel sessions develop sections concurrently. Stage = sequential unit only **inside** a section, not across plan.
> **Constraint A (DB-first):** master-plans + stages + tasks live in DB (`ia_master_plans`, `ia_stages`, `ia_tasks`, `ia_task_specs`). All planning + execution surfaces are MCP tools. No new file-based artifacts.
> **Constraint B (extend, do not duplicate):** the architecture index (mig 0034 / DEC-A16) — `arch_surfaces`, `arch_decisions`, `arch_changelog`, `stage_arch_surfaces` — plus `ia_stages.depends_on` (mig 0044), `ia_master_plan_health` MV (mig 0045), `master_plan_next_actionable` (TECH-3228), `master_plan_cross_impact_scan` (TECH-3229), `arch_drift_scan` MCP — already implement most primitives this proposal needs.
> **Constraint C (objective alignment):** every primitive must serve at least one of (1) fast prototyping, (2) parallelization of master-plan work, (3) avoidance of arch drift. Section §6 tags each delta with the objective it serves.

## 1. Problem statement

- Today: master-plan = strict global ordering Stage 1.1 → 1.2 → … → N.M, even though `depends_on` already supports a DAG. The DAG is rarely populated → topo walk degenerates to numerical order.
- Symptom A — long-lived plans: linear consumption ≈ N stages × stage cycle time. End-shape unobservable until last stage.
- Symptom B — sibling drift: `asset-pipeline` + `game-ui-design-system` + `db-lifecycle-extensions` touch overlapping `arch_surfaces`; `ia_master_plan_health` flags collisions but no plan-shape primitive forces resolution.
- Symptom C — no fanout: human can't drive multiple Claude Code sessions on one plan.
- Symptom D — no carcass milestone: nothing in the schema names the "first end-to-end visible slice" — plan completion is the only built-in milestone.

## 2. Proposal — three moves

### Move 1 — Architecture-first per plan (objective 3 — drift)

At plan birth (before any Stage row exists):

- N rows in `arch_decisions` scoped to the plan via new `plan_slug` column (e.g. `slug = 'plan-{slug}-boundaries'`).
- M rows in `arch_surfaces` for new owned surfaces.
- `ia_master_plans.architecture_locked_at timestamptz` + `locked_commit_sha text` stamped at end of authoring Phase A.
- **Hard lock trigger** on `arch_decisions`: UPDATE on `plan_slug` row blocked when parent plan has `architecture_locked_at IS NOT NULL`, except `status='superseded'` flip (single legal exit).

### Move 2 — Carcass milestone (objective 1 — fast prototyping)

- New column `ia_stages.carcass_role text` ∈ {`carcass`, `section`, NULL}.
- **Cardinality cap ≤ 3 carcass stages per plan** — enforced by Phase B authoring + DB CHECK reading `carcass_signal_kinds.max_carcass_stages_per_plan` config row.
- **Carcass-internal default = no `depends_on` edges.** Carcass stages are maximally parallel from day 0. Authoring skill warns if a carcass→carcass edge is introduced.
- "Noticeable" = `carcass_signal_kinds` table (extensible enum). Each carcass stage links to ≥1 signal kind via `stage_carcass_signals`.
- **Sections-imply-carcass invariant** (DB CHECK): a plan with any `carcass_role='section'` row MUST have ≥1 `carcass_role='carcass'` row.
- Plan health MV gains `carcass_done bool` — derived gate.

### Move 3 — Sections (objective 2 — parallelization)

- **Explicit identity** via new column `ia_stages.section_id text` (NULL for carcass + legacy stages). Author assigns at Phase C; `master_plan_sections` MCP returns sections grouped by `section_id`. Cluster detection on `arch_surfaces` becomes a **validation pass** (assert author-declared section matches surface clustering), not the source of truth.
- **Two-tier row-only claim (V2)** — section-level + stage-level, keyed by row alone:
  - `ia_section_claims (slug, section_id, claimed_at, last_heartbeat, released_at)` PK `(slug, section_id)`.
  - `ia_stage_claims (slug, stage_id, claimed_at, last_heartbeat, released_at)` PK `(slug, stage_id)`.
  - No `session_id` column — section IS the holder. INSERT-or-fail on PK enforces concurrent contention; subsequent callers refresh heartbeat. Multi-sequential agents on one section trivially safe.
  - `master_plan_next_actionable` returns a stage only if its section claim is held (any caller) AND the stage claim is unheld OR re-fetchable by row key.
- Parallel execution (V2): each agent session calls `/section-claim {slug} {section_id}` → row claim taken on `ia_section_claims` → runs `/ship-stage` per member stage on the **same branch + same worktree** → `/section-closeout` at the end. No git worktree, no per-section branch, no per-section merge — stage commits land directly via `/ship-stage` Pass B.

## 3. Why "Stage" survives only inside sections

- `Stage` semantics (atomic shippable + verify-loop + closeout) unchanged.
- What changes: the global *ordering* assumption. With `depends_on` populated and `master_plan_next_actionable` driving claim, "Stage 1.1 → 1.2 → … " is one possible topo linearization, not the contract.
- Sections impose local order via `depends_on` chains within the cluster. Cross-section order is loose — only the carcass→section gate is hard.

## 4. Implementation plan target

User confirmed: NOT a `*-master-plan.md`. DB-first, dogfood-driven. The implementation itself uses the new shape — bootstrap order resolves chicken-and-egg (§7).

## 5. Decision log

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| D1 | Carcass criteria shape | Extensible — `carcass_signal_kinds` table |
| D2 | Architecture-first persistence | `arch_decisions` rows + new `plan_slug` column |
| D3 | Carcass marker on stages | `ia_stages.carcass_role` enum column |
| D4 | Parallel coordination | `ia_stage_claims` + `ia_section_claims` (2-tier, V2 row-only) — keyed by `(slug, section_id)` / `(slug, stage_id)` alone, no session_id, no worktree, same branch |
| D5 | Migration scope | Future plans only; pilot on next plan birth |
| D6 | Authoring flow | Extend `master-plan-new` with Phases A/B/C |
| D7 | Section closeout | `section_closeout_apply` (pure-DB row-key release) — no git merge step (V2 same-branch model) |
| D8 | Branch model | V2 same-branch + same-worktree — no per-section branch, no per-section worktree, no per-section merge. Stage commits land via `/ship-stage` Pass B on the active feature branch. |
| D9 | Drift detection | Extend `arch_drift_scan` with `scope='intra-plan'` + per-stage hook in `/ship-stage` Pass B |
| D10 | Visibility | Extend `ia_master_plan_health` MV |
| D11 | Final impl-plan persistence | Dogfooding — plan itself uses new shape |
| D12 | Carcass gate semantics | Hard gate — `next_actionable` returns only carcass stages until `carcass_done=true` |
| D13 | Claim release | Auto on closeout + heartbeat sweep + manual escape |
| D14 | Lock seal columns | `architecture_locked_at` + `locked_commit_sha` on `ia_master_plans` |
| D15 | Carcass cardinality | ≤ 3 per plan (config-driven, extensible) |
| D16 | Carcass internal deps | Default none — maximally parallel internally |
| D17 | Lock enforcement | Trigger blocks in-place UPDATE on locked plan-scoped `arch_decisions` rows |
| D18 | Sections-imply-carcass | DB CHECK + Phase B authoring fail |
| D19 | Section identity | Explicit `ia_stages.section_id` column |
| D20 | `/ship-stage` integration | Pre-step `stage_claim` + section assertion; Pass B `arch_drift_scan(intra-plan)`; post-step release |
| D21 | MCP boundary | `section_closeout_apply` MCP pure-DB row-key release — no git merge in skill (V2 dropped) |
| D22 | Bootstrap shape | Single combined Wave 0 (primitives + skill extensions); dogfood as Wave 1 |

**Migration `0050_master_plan_health_carcass_extension.sql`** — adds derived columns to MV:

- `n_sections int` — `count(distinct section_id) WHERE carcass_role='section'`.
- `n_sections_done int` — sections where every member stage is `done`.
- `sections_in_flight text[]` — section_ids with active (unreleased) `ia_section_claims` rows.
- `carcass_cardinality_breach bool` — `count(carcass) > carcass_config.max_carcass_stages_per_plan` (defensive surface alongside trigger).

### 6.2 MCP tool delta

| Tool | Status | Behavior |
|------|--------|----------|
| `master_plan_next_actionable` | **modify** | Honor carcass gate (carcass_done=false → only carcass-role stages). Honor 2-tier row-only claim — return stage only if parent section claim unheld OR re-fetchable; AND stage claim unheld OR re-fetchable by row key. |
| `master_plan_sections` | **NEW** | `({slug})` → returns sections grouped by `section_id`: member stages, owned arch_surfaces, surface-cluster validation result, claim status (V2 — no session_id field). |
| `section_claim` | **NEW (V2 row-only)** | `({slug, section_id})` → INSERT-or-fail on `(slug, section_id)` PK. Throws `section_claim_held` only on concurrent INSERT race; subsequent callers refresh heartbeat (section IS holder). |
| `section_claim_release` | **NEW (V2 row-only)** | `({slug, section_id})` → set `released_at = now()` by row key. Cascade-releases stage claims for the section. Any caller may release. |
| `stage_claim` | **NEW (V2 row-only)** | `({slug, stage_id})` → assert parent section claim held; INSERT stage claim. Re-call refreshes heartbeat. |
| `stage_claim_release` | **NEW (V2 row-only)** | `({slug, stage_id})` → row-key release. |
| `claim_heartbeat` | **NEW (V2 shape)** | `({slug, section_id?, stage_id?})` → refresh row by key. Stage path also refreshes parent section claim via `ia_stages.section_id` lookup; section path cascades to all stage claims via JOIN. |
| `claims_sweep` | **NEW** | Background sweep — uses `carcass_config.claim_heartbeat_timeout_minutes`. Releases stale rows in both tables (time-based, no session). |
| `section_closeout_apply` | **NEW (pure-DB, V2)** | `({slug, section_id})` → verify all section stages done; verify zero open `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` events for section; append `master_plan_change_log` row (`kind='section_done'`); release section claim + cascade stage claims by row key alone. **Does NOT run git** — V2 same-branch same-worktree, no merge step. |
| `arch_drift_scan` | **modify** | Add `scope` arg ∈ `{global, cross-plan, intra-plan}`. `intra-plan` joins `stage_arch_surfaces × arch_changelog` grouped by section, flags cross-section surface edits. |
| `master_plan_lock_arch` | **NEW** | `({slug, commit_sha})` → set `architecture_locked_at = now()`, `locked_commit_sha = $sha`; `master_plan_change_log_append (kind='arch_locked')`. |

**Ops:** [`docs/parallel-carcass-claims-sweep-ops.md`](parallel-carcass-claims-sweep-ops.md) — claims sweep cadence + manual override + stuck-claim recovery.

### 6.3 Skill catalogue delta

> **Cross-plan convergence (2026-04-29):** all five skill surfaces below ship as **recipify-and-extend** per DEC-A19 Phase E (`docs/agent-as-recipe-runner.md` §G + §K). Engine + MCP injector live (Phase D shipped 2026-04-29, commit 6996e130). Phase 3 = first heavy-LLM dogfood for the recipe-runner. Sequence: engine regression-test backfill → 0-seam recipes (`section-claim`, `section-closeout`) → deterministic Phase A of `master-plan-new` → seam-driven Phase B/C → `stage-decompose` ext → `ship-stage` Pass A/B hooks (verify-loop subagent body stays — Phase F keeper).

**`master-plan-new` extended** — new phase order:

```
Phase A — architecture-first (D2 + D17)
  1. resolve plan slug + boundaries
  2. seed arch_surfaces (owned + shared)
  3. seed arch_decisions rows w/ plan_slug = $slug
  4. master_plan_lock_arch({slug, commit_sha=HEAD})
  5. arms the trigger — subsequent in-place UPDATEs on plan-scoped rows blocked

Phase B — carcass-define (D15 + D16 + D18)
  1. assert carcass shape selected for plan (else skip — legacy linear path)
  2. author 1..3 carcass stages (carcass_role='carcass')
       cap enforced by Phase B authoring + DB trigger
  3. for each: link signal_kinds via stage_carcass_signals (≥1 required)
  4. NO depends_on edges between carcass stages (default)
       skill warns if author insists; allowed but flagged
  5. fail-fast if Phase C will produce sections without ≥1 carcass stage

Phase C — section-decompose (D19 + D8)
  1. derive proposed section clusters from end-state contract surfaces
  2. author section stages (carcass_role='section', section_id=$id)
  3. depends_on:
       within section: sequential chain
       across section: forbidden (validated)
       section root → ≥1 carcass stage (validated)
  4. populate stage_arch_surfaces per section (owned surfaces)
  5. master_plan_sections({slug}) validation pass — surface cluster matches author intent
```

**`/section-claim` new skill** — wraps `section_claim` MCP. Pure DB row-only mutex on `(slug, section_id)`. Same branch + same worktree as the rest of the plan; no git operations. INSERT-or-fail PK enforces concurrent contention.

**`/section-closeout` new skill** — runs after every section stage `done`:

1. `arch_drift_scan(slug, scope='intra-plan', section_id)` — must return 0 open events.
2. `section_closeout_apply` MCP (pure-DB ops — releases section claim row).

No git merge, no worktree teardown — section work landed on the shared branch as stages shipped.

**`/ship-stage` extended (D20)**:

- Pass A pre-step: `stage_claim(slug, stage_id)` — INSERT-or-fail on `(slug, stage_id)` row key. Section claim row auto-asserted via `ia_stages.section_id` lookup (no caller-supplied holder id).
- Pass A iterations: periodic `claim_heartbeat({slug, stage_id})` — refreshes stage + parent section heartbeat in one MCP call.
- Pass B: existing verify-loop + **new** `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` filtered to *other* sections; hard-fail on cross-section drift; soft-warn on intra-section.
- Pass B post-step: `stage_claim_release(slug, stage_id)` — row-key release.

**`stage-decompose` extended** — emits `carcass_role` + `section_id` on every authored stage.

### 6.4 Workflow — happy path

```
Day 0  (single session — carcass wave)
  /design-explore docs/foo-exploration.md
    → Design Expansion block
  /master-plan-new docs/foo-exploration.md
    Phase A: arch_decisions seeded + master_plan_lock_arch
    Phase B: 1..3 carcass stages, no internal deps, signal_kinds linked
    Phase C: N sections, each section_id assigned, depends_on populated
  /stage-file foo Stage carcass.1
  /ship-stage foo carcass.1   ← Pass B intra-plan drift = 0 (expected)
  ... (all carcass stages, parallel-eligible)
  → ia_master_plan_health.carcass_done = true

Day N  (multiple agents OR one agent across turns — same branch, same worktree)
  Agent A:
    /section-claim foo section-A      → DB row INSERT on ia_section_claims (slug, section_id)
    /ship-stage foo section-A.1       → stage_claim row + Pass B intra-plan drift scan
    /ship-stage foo section-A.2
    /section-closeout foo section-A   → drift scan + DB closeout (releases section row)
  Agent B (parallel — different terminal, same branch + same worktree):
    /section-claim foo section-B      → INSERT-or-fail PK enforces no double-claim
    ...
  Agent C (parallel): section-C
  ...
  → all sections done → master_plan_close foo
```

### 6.5 Drift + visibility

- **Plan-birth lock seal** (Phase A): `master_plan_lock_arch` arms trigger; subsequent edits to plan-scoped `arch_decisions` blocked except `status='superseded'` (D17).
- **Per-stage drift hook** (`/ship-stage` Pass B): `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` filtered to other sections. Hard-fails ship on cross-section drift (D20).
- **Per-section closeout gate** (`/section-closeout`): `arch_drift_scan` must return zero open events (D9).
- **Plan-health surface**: `ia_master_plan_health` MV (D10) extended w/ carcass + section columns. Single MCP call shows full picture.
- **Cross-plan still served by `master_plan_cross_impact_scan`** — unchanged (intra-plan is additive).

### 6.6 Worked example — applying carcass+section to a hypothetical `game-ui-design-system-v2` plan

> Illustration only — not a commitment.

**Phase A — architecture-first locks:**

- `plan-game-ui-design-system-v2-boundaries` — owns `Assets/UI/Theme`, `Assets/Scripts/UI/Themed`, `Assets/UI/Prefabs/Generated`. Read-only on `Assets/UI/Tokens`.
- `plan-game-ui-design-system-v2-end-state-contract` — every HUD row + menu prefab consumes `UiTheme`, no hard-coded RGBA, MCP `theme_render_preview` returns matching pixels.
- `plan-game-ui-design-system-v2-shared-seams` — `UiTheme.asset` (shared with `asset-pipeline`), `UiBakeHandler` bridge command (shared with `agent-led-verification`).

**Phase B — carcass (≤3, parallel-eligible):**

- **carcass.1 — UiTheme v2 schema lands** (signal: `dev_loop_affordance`) — stub theme.asset with new fields, `UiBakeHandler` reads them; one prefab consumes the new field stub.
- **carcass.2 — Theme preview MCP** (signal: `agent_capability`) — `theme_render_preview` returns rendered prefab thumbnails for the stub theme.
- **carcass.3 — One HUD row themed end-to-end** (signal: `visible_ui`) — `vu-meter.prefab` consumes new theme schema; visible in PlayMode batch screenshot.

**Phase C — sections (parallel after carcass):**

- **section-A — Toolbar family** (5 prefabs, sequential internal): `toolbar`, `illuminated-button`, `segmented-readout`, `overlay-toggle-strip`, `themed-overlay-toggle-row`.
- **section-B — Menu family** (4 prefabs).
- **section-C — Renderers** (themed renderers under `Assets/Scripts/UI/Themed/Renderers/`).
- **section-D — Bake pipeline hardening** (`UiBakeHandler` round-trip tests, drift scan integration).
- **section-E — Docs + glossary** (terminology, design-system.md update).

5 sections — under the soft warning threshold (6). Each section claimable by a different main session post-carcass.

## 7. Implementation plan — natural prose, dogfood-driven

> **No TECH issue filing in this phase.** Implementation lands naturally. Schema + MCP primitives ship as a single combined wave (Wave 0); the rest of the system rides the new shape (Wave 1 dogfood). Future plans pilot the shape natively (Wave 2).

### Wave 0 — combined bootstrap (D22)

Single ship cycle covers schema, MCP, and skill extensions. Trade-off: bigger PR; benefit: removes inter-wave drift window (delta 1.3 + 3.4 mooted).

**Phase 1 — schema (one migration file):**

- `db/migrations/0049_parallel_carcass_primitives.sql` (entire §6.1 first block).
- `db/migrations/0050_master_plan_health_carcass_extension.sql` (MV extension).
- Run `npm run db:migrate`. Run `npm run validate:all`.

**Phase 2 — MCP tools:**

- New tool files under `tools/mcp-ia-server/src/tools/`:
  - `master-plan-sections.ts` — read-only cluster + validation query.
  - `section-claim.ts` (handles `section_claim`, `section_claim_release`).
  - `stage-claim.ts` (handles `stage_claim`, `stage_claim_release`).
  - `claim-heartbeat.ts` (handles `claim_heartbeat`, `claims_sweep`).
  - `section-closeout-apply.ts` — pure-DB closeout (NO git).
  - `master-plan-lock-arch.ts` — Phase A lock seal.
- Modify `master-plan-next-actionable.ts` — carcass gate + 2-tier claim awareness.
- Modify `arch-drift-scan.ts` — add `scope='intra-plan'` mode.
- Register all new tools in `tools/mcp-ia-server/src/index.ts`.
- Unit + integration tests under `tools/mcp-ia-server/test/`.

**Phase 3 — skill catalogue (recipify-and-extend per DEC-A19 Phase E):**

> Skill bodies ship as recipes under `tools/recipes/{name}.yaml`. SKILL.md frontmatter + change log retained; procedural prose collapses to recipe ref. `.claude/{agents,commands}/*.md` regenerated via `npm run skill:sync:all` (drift gate: `validate:recipe-drift`).

PR sub-split (5 sub-PRs — gate ordering matters):

- **PR 3.0 — engine regression-test backfill** *(new, blocks rest of Phase 3)* — engine-level smoke recipe with `mcp.*` step + asserts; golden harness via vitest. Catches engine-level regressions before heavy skills land. Source: deferred DEC-A19 Task #2 candidate.
- **PR 3.1 — `tools/recipes/section-claim.yaml`** + `ia/skills/section-claim/{SKILL.md,agent-body.md,command-body.md}` — 0 seams; pure `mcp.section_claim` row-only INSERT. No worktree, no branch.
- **PR 3.2 — `tools/recipes/section-closeout.yaml`** + `ia/skills/section-closeout/*` — 0 seams; `mcp.arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` + `gate.zero_open_events` + `mcp.section_closeout_apply` (releases section row). No git merge.
- **PR 3.3 — `tools/recipes/master-plan-new.yaml`** + `ia/skills/master-plan-new/*` extension — Phase A deterministic-only (`mcp.arch_decision_write` ×N + `mcp.master_plan_lock_arch`); Phase B/C via `seam.decompose-skeleton-stage` (existing seam, output schema extended for `carcass_role` + `section_id`).
- **PR 3.4 — `tools/recipes/stage-decompose.yaml`** + `ia/skills/stage-decompose/*` extension — 1 seam (`decompose-skeleton-stage`, reused). Validates seam I/O contract evolution.
- **PR 3.5 — `tools/recipes/ship-stage-pass-a.yaml`** + `tools/recipes/ship-stage-pass-b.yaml` + `ia/skills/ship-stage/*` extension — Pass A pre-claim recipe step (`mcp.stage_claim`); Pass B post-step recipe (`mcp.arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` + `mcp.stage_claim_release`). Verify-loop subagent body **unchanged** (multi-turn keeper per DEC-A19 Phase F).

After every PR: `npm run skill:sync:all`.

**Phase 4 — verify:**

- `npm run validate:all` (catches skill drift + DB schema drift).
- `npm run unity:compile-check` (defensive).
- `npm run verify:local`.

**Phase 5 — commit + ship.**

→ At end of Wave 0: every primitive exists. Legacy plans untouched (NULL `carcass_role` → unchanged `next_actionable` behavior).

### Wave 1 — dogfood (first plan birthed in new shape)

**Slug:** `parallel-carcass-rollout` (the rollout plan dogfooding itself for ongoing system polish).

Run `/master-plan-new docs/parallel-carcass-exploration.md` (this doc) → seeds:

**Phase A architecture locks:**

- `plan-parallel-carcass-rollout-boundaries` — owns `db/migrations/0049+`, `tools/mcp-ia-server/src/tools/{master-plan-sections,section-claim,stage-claim,claim-heartbeat,section-closeout-apply,master-plan-lock-arch}.ts`, `ia/skills/{master-plan-new,stage-decompose,ship-stage,section-claim,section-closeout}/`. Read-only on `arch_*` tables (already owned by arch-spec).
- `plan-parallel-carcass-rollout-end-state-contract` — every plan birthed after rollout uses Phase A/B/C; legacy linear path remains for plans that opt out.
- `plan-parallel-carcass-rollout-shared-seams` — `arch_decisions`, `ia_master_plans`, `ia_stages`, `ia_master_plan_health` MV.

**Phase B — 3 carcass stages (parallel-eligible):**

- **carcass.1 — Health MV proves carcass gate.** Seed synthetic plan, assert `next_actionable` returns only carcass stages. Signal: `dev_loop_affordance`.
- **carcass.2 — Row-only claim demo.** Two agents race `section_claim` on same `(slug, section_id)`; PK INSERT-or-fail enforces single winner. Signal: `agent_capability`.
- **carcass.3 — End-to-end section closeout.** Synthetic 2-stage section, run `/ship-stage` ×2 + `/section-closeout`, observe section row release + audit row + drift scan green (no git merge — same-branch + same-worktree). Signal: `runnable_prototype`.

**Phase C — sections (parallel after carcass):**

- **section-A — Drift hardening:** integration tests for `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')`, edge cases, perf bench.
- **section-B — Visibility:** web route `web/app/plans/[slug]/sections/page.tsx` consuming MV; dashboard tile.
- **section-C — Cron sweep:** scheduled `claims_sweep` job + ops docs.
- **section-D — Migration cookbook:** docs/RFC for converting future plans; explicit pilot guidance + example walkthrough (§6.6 promoted).
- **section-E — Skill train pass:** retrospect `master-plan-new`, `stage-decompose`, `ship-stage`, `section-claim`, `section-closeout` after first dogfood. Capture friction, propose deltas via `/skill-train`.

5 sections — within soft warning threshold. Each claimable by a parallel main session.

### Wave 2 — first non-bootstrap pilot

Next exploration → master-plan birth uses Phase A/B/C natively. Validate: end-to-end signal ≤ 1 stage cycle from plan birth (carcass close); section parallelism reduces total wall-clock vs legacy linear baseline.

### Risks + mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| `master_plan_next_actionable` change breaks legacy plans (no carcass stages). | Carcass gate fires only if ≥1 `carcass_role='carcass'` row for slug. Legacy slugs (all NULL) → unchanged behavior. |
| Cross-section commits collide on shared branch. | `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` runs per-stage in `/ship-stage` Pass B + per-section in `/section-closeout`; hard-fails ship on cross-section surface edits. Boundary policy + drift scan, not branch isolation, is the safety net. |
| Stale claims strand stages. | Time-based `claims_sweep` past `claim_heartbeat_timeout_minutes` + manual `claim_release(slug, section_id)`. |
| Big Wave 0 PR review burden. | Phase 1–4 changes are mechanical + isolated; one commit per phase inside the PR. |
| Lock trigger blocks legitimate edits. | Trigger only fires for `plan_slug IS NOT NULL`; supersession path remains open; skill `/architecture-supersede` (post-MVP) can wrap the workflow. |
| MV refresh cost from new derived columns. | Bench during Phase 4; if > 200ms, split into a separate `ia_plan_section_health` MV refreshed on `ia_*_claims` UPDATE only (D10 fallback). |
| Two-tier claim adds chattiness. | `claim_heartbeat({slug, stage_id})` is a single MCP call refreshing both layers (stage row + parent section row via `ia_stages.section_id` lookup); agents call once per Pass A iteration. |
| Recipe-engine bugs gate Phase 3 progress (DEC-A19 dogfood early-bind). | PR 3.0 (engine regression-test backfill) ships first; golden harness catches engine-level regressions before heavy-skill recipes land. Recipe seam refusal escalation (Q5) catches content-level. |
| Recipe DSL learning curve while Phase 3 ships. | 0-seam PRs (3.1, 3.2) come first — exercise pure deterministic step kinds before introducing seams. |

### Definition of done

- Wave 0 PR merged; `validate:all` green.
- Wave 1 `parallel-carcass-rollout` master-plan reaches `done` via the new shape.
- At least one parallel-agent demonstration: 2 sections claimed by 2 agents concurrently on the same branch + worktree, both close cleanly.
- `ia_master_plan_health` reports `carcass_done=true` + `n_sections_done=n_sections` for the rollout plan.
- `arch_drift_scan(scope='intra-plan')` green on all rollout sections at closeout.
- `/skill-train` proposals captured if friction ≥ 2 across rollout sections.

## 8. Next action

User decides invocation cadence. No TECH issue filing in this exploration — implementation lands naturally as the user drives Wave 0 work or, post-Wave 0 primitives, dogfoods the rollout plan via `/master-plan-new docs/parallel-carcass-exploration.md`.

**Wave 0 status (2026-04-29):** Phase 1 ✓ (commit 6bb0500d), Phase 2 ✓ (commit a291b520), Phase 3 deferred + early-bound to DEC-A19 Phase E (recipe-runner dogfood). Next concrete step: PR 3.0 — engine regression-test backfill (gates Phase 3 progress per §7 Wave 0 Phase 3 sub-PR list).
