## In Progress

- [ ] **BUG-25** — Fix bugs in manual street segment drawing
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `RoadManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: Documented in `.cursor/specs/road-drawing-fixes.md` (Phases 1–4) and `.cursor/specs/bridge-and-junction-fixes.md` (completed). Bridge/junction fixes and elbow prefab fix implemented; Phases 2–4 of road-drawing-fixes pending.

## High Priority

- [ ] **BUG-23** — Interstate route generation is flaky; never created in New Game flow
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `InterstateManager.cs`, `GeographyManager.cs`, `GameSaveManager.cs`, `GameBootstrap.cs`, `GridManager.cs` (ResetGrid)
  - Notes: Two sub-problems: (a) Flaky generation — sometimes Play in Unity loads without interstate. (b) New Game flow — pressing New Game never creates interstate. Fix both: ensure interstate is correctly invoked in New Game flow (ResetGrid → ReinitializeGeographyForNewGame) and fix flaky generation. Prefab/pathfinding improvements are in BUG-26 and `.cursor/specs/interstate-prefab-and-pathfinding-fixes.md`.

- [ ] **BUG-26** — Interstate prefab selection and pathfinding improvements
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `RoadPrefabResolver.cs`, `InterstateManager.cs`, `PathTerraformPlan.cs`, `TerrainManager.cs`
  - Notes: Wrong elbow prefabs, zigzag paths, environmental path choices (hugging hills), cut-through visual artifacts. Spec: `.cursor/specs/interstate-prefab-and-pathfinding-fixes.md`. Phase 1.1 (elbow fix) done; Phases 2–5 pending.

- [ ] **BUG-20** — Power plant (and 3x3/2x2 buildings) load incorrectly in LoadGame: end up under grass
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `GeographyManager.cs` (GetMultiCellBuildingMaxSortingOrder, ReCalculateSortingOrderBasedOnHeight), `BuildingPlacementService.cs` (LoadBuildingTile, RestoreBuildingTile), `GridManager.cs` (RestoreGridCellVisuals)
  - Notes: When loading a game, the power plant prefab (and possibly 2x2 water plant) is drawn under the grass tiles of the footprint. The pivot (64,102) has both grass and building as children; the building's sorting order can end up below the grass due to the "cap" in GetMultiCellBuildingMaxSortingOrder. Not yet fixed.

- [ ] **BUG-12** — Happiness UI always shows 50%
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `CityStatsUIController.cs` (GetHappiness)
  - Notes: `GetHappiness()` returns hardcoded `50.0f` instead of reading `cityStats.happiness`. Blocks FEAT-23 (dynamic happiness).

- [ ] **BUG-14** — `FindObjectOfType` in Update/per-frame degrades performance
  - Type: fix (performance)
  - Files: `CursorManager.cs` (Update), `UIManager.cs` (UpdateUI)
  - Notes: `CursorManager.Update()` calls `FindObjectOfType<UIManager>()` every frame. `UIManager.UpdateUI()` calls `FindObjectOfType` for 4 managers repeatedly. Must be cached in Start().

- [ ] **BUG-15** — `UrbanizationProposalManager` not connected to simulation
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `SimulationManager.cs`, `UrbanizationProposalManager.cs`
  - Notes: `SimulationManager.ProcessSimulationTick()` never calls `UrbanizationProposalManager.ProcessTick()`. Urbanization proposals are disabled.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **BUG-19** — Mouse scroll wheel in Load Game scrollable menu also triggers camera zoom
  - Type: fix (UX)
  - Files: `CameraController.cs` (HandleScrollZoom), `UIManager.cs` (loadGameMenu, savedGamesListContainer), `MainScene.unity` (LoadGameMenuPanel / Scroll View hierarchy)
  - Notes: When scrolling over the Load Game save list, the mouse wheel scrolls the list AND zooms the camera. The scroll should only move the list up/down, not affect camera zoom or other game mechanisms that use the scroll wheel.
  - Proposed solution: In `CameraController.HandleScrollZoom()`, check `EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject()` before processing scroll. If the pointer is over UI (e.g. Load Game panel, Building Selector, any scrollable popup), skip the zoom logic and let the UI consume the scroll. This mirrors how `GridManager` already gates mouse clicks via `IsPointerOverGameObject()`. Requires `using UnityEngine.EventSystems`. Verify that the Load Game ScrollRect (Scroll View) has proper raycast target so `IsPointerOverGameObject()` returns true when hovering over it.

- [ ] **BUG-16** — Possible race condition in GeographyManager vs TimeManager initialization
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `GeographyManager.cs`, `TimeManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: Unity does not guarantee Start() order. If TimeManager.Update() runs before GeographyManager creates the grid, it may access non-existent data. Use Script Execution Order or gate with `isInitialized`.

- [ ] **BUG-17** — `cachedCamera` is null when creating `ChunkCullingSystem`
  - Type: fix
  - Files: `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: In InitializeGrid() ChunkCullingSystem is created with `cachedCamera`, but it is only assigned in Update(). May cause NullReferenceException.

- [ ] **BUG-13** — `FindObjectOfType<TimeManager>()` called every tick in UrbanizationProposalManager
  - Type: fix (performance)
  - Files: `UrbanizationProposalManager.cs` (ProcessTick)
  - Notes: `FindObjectOfType` is expensive and runs every simulation tick. Cache in Start().

- [ ] **FEAT-21** — Expenses and maintenance system
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `EconomyManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs`
  - Notes: No expenses: no street maintenance, no service costs, no salaries. Without expenses there is no economic tension. Add upkeep for streets, public buildings and services.

- [ ] **FEAT-24** — Auto-zoning for Medium and Heavy density
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `AutoZoningManager.cs`, `DemandManager.cs`
  - Notes: AutoZoningManager only places Light zones. Should support Medium/Heavy based on demand or zone development level.

- [ ] **FEAT-22** — Tax feedback on demand and happiness
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `EconomyManager.cs`, `DemandManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs`
  - Notes: High taxes do not affect demand or happiness. Loop: high taxes → less residential demand → less growth → less income.
  - Depends on: BUG-02

- [ ] **FEAT-23** — Dynamic happiness based on city conditions
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `CityStats.cs`, `DemandManager.cs`, `EmploymentManager.cs`
  - Notes: Happiness only increases when placing zones (+100 per building). No effect from unemployment, taxes, services or pollution. Should be continuous multi-factor calculation with decay.
  - Depends on: BUG-12

- [ ] **FEAT-36** — Expand auto-zoning and auto-road candidates to include forests and slopes
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `GridManager.cs`, `AutoZoningManager.cs`, `AutoRoadBuilder.cs`
  - Notes: Treat Grass, Forest, and N-S/E-W slopes as valid candidates for zoning and road expansion. Plan: `docs/plan-zoning-road-candidates-grass-forest-slopes.md`.

- [ ] **FEAT-35** — Area demolition tool (bulldozer drag-to-select)
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `GridManager.cs`, `UIManager.cs`, `CursorManager.cs`
  - Notes: Manual tool to demolish all buildings and zoning in a rectangular area at once. Use the same area selection mechanism as zoning: hold mouse button, drag to define rectangle, release to demolish. Reuse zoning's start/end position logic (zoningStartGridPosition, zoningEndGridPosition pattern). Demolish each cell in the selected area via DemolishCellAt. Interstate Highway cells must remain non-demolishable. Consider preview overlay (e.g. red tint) during drag.

- [ ] **FEAT-03** — Forest mode hold-to-place
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `ForestManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: Currently requires click per cell. Allow continuous drag.

- [ ] **FEAT-04** — Random forest spray tool
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `ForestManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`, `CursorManager.cs`
  - Notes: Place forest in area with random spray/brush distribution.

- [ ] **BUG-08** — More small rivers, rivers reach lakes, define sea at corner/edge
  - Type: fix/feature
  - Files: `WaterManager.cs`, `WaterMap.cs`, `GeographyManager.cs`
  - Notes: Improve map water generation.

- [ ] **FEAT-06** — Forest that grows over time: sparse → medium → dense
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `ForestManager.cs`, `ForestMap.cs`, `SimulationManager.cs`
  - Notes: Forest maturation system over simulation time.

- [ ] **FEAT-08** — Property value simulation, respawning and evolution to larger buildings
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `GrowthManager.cs`, `ZoneManager.cs`, `DemandManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs`
  - Notes: Existing buildings evolve to larger versions based on zone property value.


## Code Health (technical debt)

- [ ] **TECH-04** — Remove direct access to `gridArray`/`cellArray` outside GridManager
  - Type: refactor
  - Files: `WaterManager.cs`, `GridSortingOrderService.cs`, `GeographyManager.cs`, `BuildingPlacementService.cs`
  - Notes: Project rule: use `GetCell(x, y)` instead of direct array access. Several classes violate this. Risk of subtle bugs when grid changes.

- [ ] **TECH-01** — Extract responsibilities from large files (GridManager, TerrainManager, CityStats, ZoneManager, UIManager, RoadManager)
  - Type: refactor
  - Files: `GridManager.cs` (~1870 lines), `TerrainManager.cs` (~1660), `CityStats.cs` (~1200), `ZoneManager.cs` (~1360), `UIManager.cs` (~1240), `RoadManager.cs` (~1510)
  - Notes: Helpers already extracted (GridPathfinder, GridSortingOrderService, etc.). Pending candidates: BulldozeHandler (~200 lines), GridInputHandler (~130 lines), CoordinateConversionService (~230 lines) from GridManager.

- [ ] **TECH-02** — Change public fields to `[SerializeField] private` in managers
  - Type: refactor
  - Files: `ZoneManager.cs`, `RoadManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs`, `AutoZoningManager.cs`, `AutoRoadBuilder.cs`, `UIManager.cs`, `WaterManager.cs`, `UrbanizationProposalManager.cs`
  - Notes: Dependencies and prefabs exposed as `public` allow accidental access from any class. Use `[SerializeField] private` to encapsulate.

- [ ] **TECH-03** — Extract magic numbers to constants or ScriptableObjects
  - Type: refactor
  - Files: multiple (GridManager, CityStats, RoadManager, UIManager, TimeManager, TerrainManager, WaterManager, EconomyManager, ForestManager, InterstateManager, etc.)
  - Notes: Building costs, economic balance, generation parameters, sorting order offsets, initial dates, probabilities — all hardcoded. Extract to named constants or configuration ScriptableObject for easier tuning.

- [ ] **TECH-05** — Extract duplicated dependency resolution pattern
  - Type: refactor
  - Files: ~25+ managers with `if (X == null) X = FindObjectOfType<X>()` block
  - Notes: Consider helper method, base class, or extension method to reduce duplication of Inspector + FindObjectOfType fallback pattern.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **FEAT-09** — Trade / Production / Salaries
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: `EconomyManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs` (+ new managers)
  - Notes: Economic system of production, trade between zones and salaries.

- [ ] **FEAT-18** — Terrain generator (improved)
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `TerrainManager.cs`, `GeographyManager.cs`, `HeightMap.cs`
  - Notes: Terrain generator with more control and variety.

- [ ] **FEAT-10** — Regional contribution: monthly bonus for belonging to the state
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `EconomyManager.cs`, `CityStats.cs`, `RegionalMapManager.cs`
  - Notes: Additional monthly income for belonging to regional network.

- [ ] **FEAT-19** — Map rotation / prefabs
  - Type: feature
  - Files: `CameraController.cs`, `GridManager.cs`, all rendering managers
  - Notes: Isometric view rotation. High impact on sorting order and rendering.

- [ ] **FEAT-11** — Education level / Schools
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new managers + `CityStats.cs`, `DemandManager.cs`
  - Notes: Education system affecting demand and growth.

- [ ] **FEAT-12** — Security / Order / Police
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new managers + `CityStats.cs`
  - Notes: Public security system.

- [ ] **FEAT-13** — Fire / Fire risk / Firefighters
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new managers + `CityStats.cs`
  - Notes: Fire risk and firefighter service system.

- [ ] **FEAT-14** — Vehicle traffic system / traffic animations
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new manager + `RoadManager.cs`, `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: Vehicles circulating on streets.

- [ ] **FEAT-15** — Port system / cargo ship animations
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new manager + `WaterManager.cs`
  - Notes: Requires water system with defined sea (depends on BUG-08).

- [ ] **FEAT-16** — Train system / train animations
  - Type: feature (new system)
  - Files: new manager + `GridManager.cs`
  - Notes: Railway network and animations.

- [ ] **ART-01** — Missing prefabs: forests on SE, NE, SW, NW slopes
  - Type: art/assets
  - Files: prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs/`, `ForestManager.cs`

- [ ] **ART-02** — Missing prefabs: residential (2 heavy 1x1/2x2, light 2x2, medium 1x1)
  - Type: art/assets
  - Files: prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs/`, `ZoneManager.cs`

- [ ] **ART-03** — Missing prefabs: commercial (2 heavy 2x2/1x1, light 2x2, medium 2x2)
  - Type: art/assets
  - Files: prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs/`, `ZoneManager.cs`

- [ ] **ART-04** — Missing prefabs: industrial (2 heavy 2x2/1x1, light 1x1, 2 medium 1x1/2x2)
  - Type: art/assets
  - Files: prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs/`, `ZoneManager.cs`

- [ ] **AUDIO-01** — Audio FX: demolition, placement, zoning, forest, 3 music themes, ambient effects
  - Type: audio/feature
  - Files: new AudioManager + audio assets
  - Notes: Ambient effects must vary by camera position and height over the map.
